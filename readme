The goal of this project is to automate the diagnostic process in order to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD)
with chest X-rays. In terms of business, hospitals rely heavily on doctors for diagnostics via various imaging examinations. As a result, this CAD
project is geared toward hospitals that want to increase efficiency by automating diagnosis procedures and making better use of their doctors.
